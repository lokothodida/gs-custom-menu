# GetSimple (GS) Custom Menu
Build custom navigational menus in GetSimple CMS completely independently of the existing *Pages* menu.

## Features

+ Build nested/hierarchical structures (as you could with the built-in GetSimple navigation)
+ Add any URLs to the list, external or internal, regardless of whether the page exists (e.g. dummy pages, dynamically generated pages, etc...)
+ Create any number of menus desired, for any required purpose
+ Dead-simple to make an item open its link externally
+ Has placeholder `(% custom_menu 'menuname' %)` to allow function to be called in page content also
+ Menus are generated entirely independent of existing built-in menu navigation - they will not affect that original menu
+ Images can be used instead of text (v0.5+)
+ Available in English, Italian, Russian and German (Google Translations) and in French
