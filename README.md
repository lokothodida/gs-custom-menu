gs_custom_menu: Custom Menu
===========================

At the time of publishing, there hasn't being a plugin that lets you build menus independently of pages (i.e. entries have to be added into the template file manually). This plugin seeks to try and solve that issue.

## Features

+ Build nested/hierarchical structures (as you could with the built-in GetSimple navigation)
+ Add any URLs to the list, external or internal, regardless of whether the page exists (e.g. dummy pages, dynamically generated pages, etc...)
+ Create any number of menus desired, for any required purpose
+ Dead-simple to make an item open its link externally
+ Has placeholder (% custom_menu 'menuname' %) to allow function to be called in page content also
+ Menus are generated entirely independent of existing built-in menu navigation - they will not affect that original menu
+ Images can be used instead of text (v0.5+)
+ Available in English, Italian, Russian and German (Google Translations) and in French
